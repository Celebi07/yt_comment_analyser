"This guy actually puts in a lot of effort in his tutorials as far as i can infer. I noticed that whenever he accidentally said something wrong for example he said age instead of name, he'll put the correct word in the background, meaning that he actually gone through the entire video again before publishing to check for errors.",s
"I've learnt HTML, CSS, Javascript and Python all from this dude. Trust me watch all of the videos and you will learn alot. Im a huge fan of giraffe academy!",s
Watched this video one year ago to start my coding journey... now I'm just finishing up my first internship as a software developer. Crazy to think about how far I've come and looking back at where I started..... Don't give up guys u can do it,s
"His teaching is the most effective I've found so far on YouTube or Udemy, specifically for the language tutorials.
No extra theory crap, not a tons load of ""useless rant""; straight to the point topics and very easily covering most of the important areas!
Thanks, Mike!",s
"I finally finished the whole 4 hours, and now i'm taking my first steps towards world domination",p

"Damn, after seeing the first 30 minutes of this video,  I really appreciate how freaking easy Python is lol",p
This man literally taught me more in 4 hours than my uni taught me an whole semester,p
"C++ is one of the most complex languages out there and that's good. C++ is WAYYYY faster than Python and is therefore preferred by companies where speed is key (like for example banks for financial transactions, security systems and other areas). when you want it to be as fast as possible, C++ is the best mediator between being user-friendly and being fast. it's the halfway point between assembly language and python",s
"I needed to learn something about C++ in a hurry.
My first thought was to seek you out (again).
As expected, you were clear and concise and made it all so easy.
You are a superstar.",p
Honestly one of the best and most thorough introductions to C++ ive ever watched. Thank you,p

"Just watched this to refresh my basic c++ knowledge and since I used a different IDE, VS19 to be specific, the variable at 2:21:40 (int guess;) needs to have a value for that compiler, just change that to int guess = -1; Or that is how I fixed it.",s
i literally have an exam in a couple of hours so time to put it to 1.5x speed and learn the whole semester in a couple of hours,s
"Mike does such a well job at teaching, he's helped me learn Web Dev, and Python now I'm trying to learn C++",p

HE IS THE KING!!!!üëëüëëüëë",p
"I learned more in the first 40 minutes than I have in 2 weeks in my high school C++ class, nice video",p
"This guy in just 4 hours, taught me what my teachers failed to teach me in 15 weeks. I don't know if its a psychological thing that makes it easier to learn from youtube videos or if i really got so unlucky with my teachers",o
"In the beginning, I wasn't very impressed, but later I realized it's actually a very good course. Congrats. Btw I wonder how much more is there to learn to become a C++ pro.",q
I watched this video in 2x for quick revision. You taught more of C++ than what I learned in 2 years of school in that subject. Thanks a lot for the video!,p
Went through the entire 4 hours. This Tutorial is amazingly helpful. Thanks man.,p

"This tutorial is awesome!! But i thought i should mention that in Visual Studio developed by Microsoft, ""string"" is used differently. One has to actually type #include <string> at the top in order to be able to use that sort of data (one can also use ""const char*""). I spent an hour yesterday trying to figure it out. I am someone who just started programming and i really enjoy it ; regardless I am still just a beginner of no programming background. I may not know much but I'm just trying to share my findings so that others like me can also find their way. Thank you for the awesome tutorial!!",s
"Great tutorial! Its hard to find someone who explains the basics as well as touching on more commonly used variables. Also, thank you for leaving in your mistakes. It helps knowing that experienced programmers still miss common mistakes.",p

These basics are not only C++ basics, but all these concepts are almost identical or very similar to some other programming languages.
I've learned it the hard way, by sitting here for 4 hours and watching this course to find out I had all these concepts already down from Java (which took me far more than 4 hours to understand, by just reading code and trying to figure it out on my own).


This was really beneficial tho to strengthen these concepts and really make them mine.",s

To print ANY text you will need to use cout << ""TEXT HERE"" << endl;

The Data Types are:

string (Just to store some plain text)
char (Only used to store ONE Character)
int (Can only store whole numbers)
double (Can store more numbers than int AND can also be used for precise numbers like a decimal)
float (Can be used to make decimals)
bool (Bascially it's true or false, this isn't important if you haven't learned about if and else statements yet.)",s

"You should mention that ""using namespace std;"" is really only acceptable for very small programs. You should not use it if your program will do non-trivial work, as you will likely get naming collision of your functions with the standard library. Instead, always prefix standard library functions or types with std::
(Trust me, it's not that hard to get used to and you'll avoid a ton of bugs)

For, say, print-heavy functions, you could prefix the code inside a function with ""using std::cout; using std::endl;"" to then not have to write std::cout and std::endl all the time (instead only writing cout and endl)

And finally, don't overuse std::endl. Most of the time all you want is to add a \n. This is because std::endl flushes the output, which is slower than just writing a newline character to the stream (my benchmark for instance yielded 100% speed improvement using \n over std::endl)",s
Dude I dont know if you know but this tutorial is one of THE CLEANEST CONCISE on youtube. The way you get to the point and explain well in brief manner makes learning C++ seem intuitive. I know this is just the surface but it is presented in a way that makes it feel breezy and effortless,p

"thanks for sharing your knowledge, its pretty useful for me !  great work man carry on !!!",p
freeCodeCamp has been so much more in-depth than my instructors. You guys provide such good material. I've used your videos for almost every language Im learning and retained a heck of a lot more than just from reading!,p

Done 2 months of learning thisüåùThank you Mike!,p
Wow thank you!!! I've learned a lot from you!!!,p
"2:22:42 i did my homework before Mike told me to. I didnt use do/while loop, but i made the program tell you if you guessed too high or too low and also tell you how many tries it took you to guess the number. 
I love this course",o

"This guy actually puts in a lot of effort in his tutorials as far as i can infer. I noticed that whenever he accidentally said something wrong for example he said age instead of name, he'll put the correct word in the background, meaning that he actually gone through the entire video again before publishing to check for errors.",p
"I really like the way you teach but I have to say, the best part was seeing you use the LOST numbers as luckyNums üòä",p

Wonderful thanks a lot sir‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è,p
tutorial from Dude is always awesome. You are my favourite teacher.,p
Genius spotted. I attended my 1st day as IT student and my prof was having a hard time to explain on the fundamentals of Programming. But this man just give a free knowledge and he's good on explaining. Jeez thanks Bro,p
Life saver!  Uni's may as well show this concise tutorial rather than showing hundreds of hours of lectures and explanations to literally explain what you accomplished only in a few hours.,p
Precise and concise. Thanks a ton.,p
Finally I was finished in this video full. It has taken a one week.,o
Thanks for doing the work my professor can‚Äôt do,p

I'm paying so much money for a professor who can't and doesn't even teach! SO THANKFUL I FOUND THIS! My last hw assignment got me a C (randomly just typing things) and after watching this I got an A! So simple and easy to understand. I was able to take down notes and able to RUN a project! THANK YOU SOOOO MUCH!,p
"I worked as a computer scientist in the physics field for years using a mixed language parallel programming technique (C & Fortran & MPI) to get the best of both world and I do confess it works fairly well.
Currently retired, I go on and besides this I want to explore new programming techniques I had few or no time to learn when I was active due to too close milestones.
Learning C++ from scratch from bulky books is not that easy so I tried numerous tutorials. Some of them were good some not. Eventually, I found the best ever : yours.
It fulfills all my expectations. 
Explanations are crystal clear and, moreover, they highlight the philosophy of C++. 
You deserve to become a professor if it is not the case yet. 
Thank you very much.",p

"The ""Building a Guessing Game"" tutorial has a flaw - the 'guess' variable is uninitialized when the 'while' loop tries to evaluate it, so the code has UNDEFINED BEHAVIOR.  The 'guess' variable needs to be explicitly initialized to a value other than 7 so the 'while' loop will run correctly.  Otherwise, the code should be modified to use a 'do..while' loop instead.",s

"35:30  The amount of decimal places(to the right of the decimal point) a float/double can store precisely can also be directly affected by how many digits are to the left of the decimal point as well... That's why this is referred to as a loss of precision, because it's only precise to a certain extent. There are other datatypes that overcome this. This loss of precision is because of the amount of bytes allocated to these datatypes.",s
My teacher also had polymorphism and template functions and objects. Also this pointers. But I guess that's too advanced for a beginner class,s

"Hey guys!
How about if we need to print out all the data in a class rather than just one data. For example, we need to print out, in Movie, all the data instead of just 
cout << avengers. title;
cout << avengers.director; ...

Is there a way to do this?
Asking for this, for example in an instance where we have a lot of data in a class and we need to print out all the data rather than just one or two or even ten.
Thanks!",q

"You definintely touched in a lot of good points, but there is a LOT of missing pieces of an awesome tutorial. First, missing the ""struct"" and how to properly handle exceptions. A good part of C++ programming is also interfacing with the OS and the multiple OSs that are out there. The total basics were not covered for example, some more data structures, date and time, basic input/output, namespaces, dynamic memory, etc. Furthermore if you actually say to someone that you are going to teach objects... well... it's only 20% accomplished. For example, multiple inheritance, polymorphism, abstraction, encapsulation, interfaces, etc. If you could please make an advanced class and cover more topics.

"In the exponent function tutorial, it is better to include case 'power number is negative.'
I would prefer the following function:

        for (int i = 0; i < powNum; i++) {

If you've watched this whole thing then you don't know the difference between stack & heap memory and therefore you don't know about the lifetimes of the stuff you are creating in memory. You won't be able to write successful C++ programs without knowing this.

I would recommend reading that or something like it otherwise you won't know what you are doing.",s

"2:39:10 , I did it in a much simpler way, shorter and only needs 1 more variable:

#include <iostream>
#include <ostream>
using namespace std;
 
int main() {
 
	int secretNum = 7;
	int guess{};
	int numguess = 1;
 
 
 
	while (secretNum != guess) {
		if (numguess <= 5) {
			cout << ""Enter guess: "";

		}
		else {
			cout << ""Maximum number of guesses reached. You lose!"";
			return 0;
		}
 
	}
	cout << ""You win!"";
}
 
You can see that all I did was add numguess, which is the number of guesses you've made. After that, in the while loop, I put an if else statement that repeats itself (because it is in the while loop), to check if the user has guessed less than 5 times. Hopefully this helps",s

	int guess = 0;
	int usr_guesses = 0;

MY CONFUSION is, I use MACROS to operate the POINTs which in turn will change the Signal, as a Set. So how can I run trains and they go past a Signal that is operated via a Point, as mentioned earlier, this Signal will change from GREEN to RED, the Signal ahead should change to YELLOW, the Next Ahead will be RED, all this WITHOUT changing the POINTS",q

"really love your coding tutorials been learning C++ an python from you recently. One thing i could say though that i think would be beneficial, at the end of each lesson or after like 2 or 3 lesson send us off on our own to try and write a small piece of code. Then next video you come back and go over the possible outcomes we could of had and go over what we did and why. that would get us learning as to why we do what we do instead of just following along and then being lost when it comes to executing these scenarios without guidance. 
one other thing would be when you make something where we respond to a true or false it would mean wonders if you showed how to get user input to ask about those true and falses. Like for example in the isMale and isTall example add a way to ask the user if they are tall or male NOT by just physically changing the code but by asking for input.

Sample the basics of what most modern languages have, loops, ifs, var types, methods, functions, objects and so on into one course.

Good job. It's like going through a full paid course!!!!!,p
great video,p
"The description of the *break* statement in the switch section isn't quite correct.
Without ""break;"" the code will continue downward, executing each successive case whether or not the switch value (dayNum) equals those case statements. The ""break;"" simply prevents the switch from continuing this way.

Don't think of ""case: 3"" as meaning: ""execute this code if the switch is equal to 3""; think of it more as: ""execute all the switch code, _starting here_.

So a switch is even more versatile than a multi-condition if statement.",s
congratulations Sir For 5 million I hope you soon got 10 million subscribers,p
you are really great at teaching!,p
Awesome Video. Fully Understood the concept. Thank you so much.,p
I have a MacBook Pro and I tried downloading code blocks but it wasn't updated for the current MacOs I'm currently on. What should I download instead?,q
Thank you so much for this! I really appreciate you uploading this tutorial :),p
"Why does the lenght function not work ?
I wrote the code exactly like him ,I created a string ,called it phrase ,then I wrote a cout line in which i wrote phrase.lenght();   ,and it fidnt work ,it didnt want to start",q

Thanks!,p
"Dude this was so awesome and EXACTLY what I needed for a refresher course, thanks for putting in the time",p
"I was watching this video but then I signed for a Programming Language Course in which they were using Python so I changed to Python! I love more Python than C++, though C++ is really good.",o
"It is excellent  . You always use same story and same concept to teach languages . 
I liked  that story .",s
Finally got my procrastinating self through the entirety of the video. I come from a background of knowing C and Python so I was familiar with a lot of the concepts but I did learn a lot and discovered the differences between C and C++. Great video!,p

"This guy is the best teacher! He goes through every step and explains why the program is doing this or that and yet it's never boring or overkill. It's just enough info for a complete beginner to get a good foundation without feeling like it's too much. Amazing video, really!",p
I really troubled with C++ because I don't understand anything what my teacher says. I begin to learning more and became more understand thanks to you :)),p
Thanks!,p
This was really awesome ! Like superbüëåüëè ! Thanks man !!‚úå‚úå,p
Pov: You came from this guy‚Äôs C tutorial.,p
Brilliant tutorial. Helped me out with C++ and Java. Thank you so much <3,p
Great video ! Bravo ! Thank you very much !,p
Simplest explaination of classes and objects I have found on the internet,p
2.2 Thousand people unlike the video just because unlike option is available there and there must be use of that option. The video doesn't deserve it where you can learn C++ as a absolute beginner.,p
"Watching this comes in handy in middle school.
My older brother is still learning to code in collage",p
11:02 what do I do if that black window pops up but it does not show ‚ÄúHello World!‚Äù It just show other stuff. And the code is the exact same as his.,q
"Fabulous!
I have also taught before.
World class tutoring!
God bless!",p
Wonderful job.Very helpful.,p
Can anyone explain why someone would even dislike this amazing video? I'm really curious. This guy is simply amazing,p
"4 hours, no ads, from start to finish, no cost...dude, massive respect, universities need to watch their back!!",p
"This is a great tutorial, sound is good ( e.g. good to listen is a noisy bus on my way to work) and no annoying background sound.
No distracting  background not related to the stuff.  Thanks a lot for the video, I'm now trying to do what you are teaching here!",p
"Hi, can someone help me understand why this is happening?

    getline(cin, name);
    cout << ""You are "" << name << "". Your grade is "" << grade << "". Your age is "" << age <<""."";
    return 0;

So basically, the code isn't letting me enter the name after ""Enter your name:"". I have to enter my name immediately after the age with no spaces. Please help me understand why this is the case and what should I do to fix it?",q
"If you want to understand how int main() {} works, just compare it to a basket full of apples. ""main(){}"" is a space where apples are stored. ""cout"" is like ""start writing here"" and ""endl"" is : ""End here"". ""return 0"" = ""Tell me about the basket""",s

"I started my second degree in IT Managment almost 3 months ago, and then I got super hooked in coding! The subject for the first quarter is C++, we will still learn Python, JAVA and JS until the end of the degree.

So I am watching this tutorial to get even more practice and tips, and also the JS course. After I felt a little more confident with C++ I will start Python. My goal is a Full Stack career and I already have some personal projects to start working on until the end of this semester!

"for 'building a better calculator' 1:55:58 - when the user inputs an invalid operator, console message is ""Invalid operator"", as planned, and then has a weird string of numbers with some massive or tiny exponent value, depending on what you typed as the invalid operator. i'm guessing this is because cout << result; is still getting called, even after we've cycled through the else statement, so how do you stop it from getting called in the instance of an invalid operator?",q
I finished a few chapters but I forgot everything afterwards,o
"Sometimes there might be a error if you don't put in a   '; '  before ""return 0""",s

This course was great but there is so much more to C++, including:
 
  Using Structs, Enums, Unions
  Poymorphism & Templates
  Actually using pointers and references
  Object life cycle
  Memory management; malloc(), calloc(), new, delete, ...
  Lambda expressions
  Std library, etc.
  Saving & retrieving data (reading and writing files; using databases)
  Writing an actual application
  Including basic GUI elements
  (And many more things.)
 
(Of course I don't expect these to be included within 4 hours ‚Äì though an extra hour to cover some of these would have been great.) But... now where can I learn these without having to cover the first four hours again in a more in-depth course? Is there anything that would flow on nicely from this?",q

Now become tooooo silly, and not just that, I just finish them in only two weeks, back at collage when I took them in four months I did not even remember a single code. I mean comon like when I took these courses in my university my professor used to make fun of some students including me.

Thank you absolute legend,p
Just a n00b Q: in Python many people seem to rave about Sublime as a text editor while I haven't heard that mentioned elsewhere (i.e other languages). Is there a reason for that or is it just a trend? Would I be fine using Sublime for my C/C++?,q

"Not a bad tutorial, but I wouldn't necessarily consider this a ""C++"". It just teaches you the basic concepts of programming (e.g. pointers, objects, if statements, for and while loops, etc...) which can be implemented in most languages.

Damn! Thanks sir you taught me arrays,p
no offence but bro i like watched 3 hours and 10 mins but i feel like he gives the idea like 10x slower than it should take,s
its best to watch at speed 1.25,s

Here from Clumsy‚Äôs video,o
I finished the course but I‚Äôm curious what is the next step? This has given me a good understanding of the different rules and commands you can use in c++ but I still don‚Äôt feel like I could actually put together any sort of useful program. For example I how do I create code that can gather information from outside sources not just what I enter. How do I make code interact with other software or hardware? I‚Äôd like to know what would be the next step in learning c++,q

I can enter a number with cin just fine, but as soon as i press enter, the program basically skips the next part.

help?

[EDIT]
So apparently the problem is that if you use cin first, it will leave a newline in the buffer, which will stay and cause getline() to skip input.
You can fix this by using cin.ignore(), but I don't know how that exactly works. The easier temporary solution is to just use getline() before cin.",q

Hi guys I am just 13 years old. My school is off because of lockdown due to coronavirus. And I thought it would be very much fun to learn this c++ beginner language. And yes it is very much fun. And THANKS to the youtuber because he is making all us learn it free and even without ads. Ads in video are just like when we get holiday from school,p
1:42:00,o
I agree with you C++ the first program to learn. Why? Because it's the toughest and hardest to learn language. Once you get to know C++ other languages are easy ... I don't know if Fortran or Assembly is much complicated since I have never learned it yet but it doesn't mean I have no idea about it...,s

this guy is the best at teaching programming,p
This is probably gonna be the first time i watch a video over an hour,o
14:32,o
I am new to C++ and less than half way through the video I figured how to use if statements and loops lol.,p
41:30,o
"I have a question.
How we can make a counter that show us how many guesses we gave before we guessed  the secretNum? 
Sorry if i didn't –µxpress myself correct.",q
YOU ARE A REALLY GOOD PROGRAMMING TEACHER! (LOVE FROM INDIA),p
Anyone of you who had written notes of this video i need them kindly tell me. Please üôèüôèüôèüôèü•∫ü•∫ü•∫,q
"c++ is kinda lit, little tough considering python, for me python was simply logic based and super easy to understand, c++ doesn't seem too hard just a little different",p
pls help I have to code a robot in a month where do I even start,q
"You are getting the biggest f'ing thumbs up from me.  
It's by far the best tutorial I have ever seen.",p
"At the 1:40 mark, where you entered the statement bool isMale = true; and bool isTall = true I couldn't initially get it to work.  In order to fix it I put a semicolon at the isTall; Otherwise it would get stuck at the if function.  I don't know why you didn't run into the same issue, or if this is really a fix, but it allowed the function to work.",q
39:00,o
"Now. Because C++ is awesome it gives us another data type.. bullyin lmao


It‚Äôs a joke btw

Edit: Also this is the best tutorial ever thanks dude.",o
its pretty similiar to python ngl,o
"Hi, I could use some help from someone, it would be appreciated. At 2:20:20 building a guessing game i have the same code he has but i get an error for uninitialized local variable , heres the code I have: 

int main()
{
    int secretNum = 7;
    int yourGuess;
 
    while(secretNum != yourGuess) {
        cout << ""Enter guess from  1 - 9: "";
        cin >> yourGuess;
    }
 
    cout << ""You win!"";
 
    return 0;
}
the error comes up for line 6 (while(secretNum != yourGuess) {) it says yourGuess isn't initialized. 
However I could get this exact same code to work with a do while loop, I'm just curious why its not working with a regular while loop.",q
"At 2:21:42 when coding the guessing game, I kept getting an error that said Using uninitialized memory 'guess' and it was only resolved when I declared the variable before the main function. How did yours work when you declared the variable inside the function and mine did not?",q

"Hi! Can someone help me with my C++ homework? It's below:

Write a program that uses random number generations to create sentences.
The program should use four arrays of pointers to char called article,noun verb and preposition. The program should create a sentence by selecting a word at random from which array in the following order: article, noun, verb, preposition, article and noun. As each word is picked it should be concatenated to the previous word in a character array that is big enough to hold the entire sentence. The words should be separated by spaces. When the final sentence is output , it should start with a capital letter and end with a period. The program should generate 20 such sentences. The arrays should be filled as follows: The article array should contain the articles ""the"" , ""a"" , "" one"" , ""some"" and ""any"" ; the noun array should contain the nouns ""boy"", ""girl"" , "" dog"" ,  ""town"" and ""car""; the verb array should contain the verbs ""drove"" , ""jumped"" , ""ran"", ""walked "" and ""skipped ""; the preposition array should contain the prepositions ""to"", ""from"" , ""over"", ""under"" and ""on"". After completing the program, modify it to produce a short story consisting of several of these sentences. (How about a random -term paper writer!)",q
52:30,o
"I'm still learning c++ in first semester at college, but when you talk about pointers you nearly always meant references, no? The pointer is only the variable with the *, the reference is the variable with the &.",q

Lua programmers understanded more then enough!,o
Just awesome,p
31:00,o

Btw thanks for your effort my guy!",p

"In C++, is the same const char* than string??, because i prefer to use const char*, and in C for example you can do this:
char* word = ""freeCodeCamp"";
printf(""%s\n"", word);

Such an useful video ‚ù§Ô∏è I hate programmings actually but I never felt bored for even a sec. your way of speech was so understandable. Thanks mike üôÇ,p
"Thank you for saving my life! You explained things so well, and all the contents are so organized! Now I have a better overview over C++.",p
the text editor that i used was vs code,o
you're such a great and helpful teacher! thank you for explaining everything so well and saving my grade (hopefully). Keep up the good work!,p
I got errors thrown trying to put the or symbols in during the getting and setting part of the video.,q
"I've learned a lot from these tutorials. I'm in my 2nd year of programming still I can't understand about c++. Thanks for this, now I refresh all the lessons that were taught last year. üòç",p
i have a test in 3 days and i've learnt a lot more than i have from my lecturer in the last 4 weeks. love this,p
God bless all of you.,p
This is so helpful because I just started a course at College about programming and I never did programing in high school so this is so cool :D Thanks a bunch. Now I can be a step forward before the teacher :D,p
34:47,o
"thank you sir, please continue helping others by creating such precious videos,it is a very helpful video for us",p
"Thanks, Mike great course.  I really appreciate all the efforts you put into your course.",p

Thankyou for this course I am about to start my UG in Computer Science and Engineering and this course has probably given me a push start and alot of confidenceüôèüî•üôè,p
16:24,o
"Thanks Mike for your incredible courses! Never seen a person talk so easy to understand, the best tutorial I have ever seen =)",p
"Nice tutorials and very helpful.

Thanks mike, 
Keep it up.....",p
52:00,o
"Wow, such a great teacher. It would be great if you could make an intermediate level also.",p
49:27,o
"I really like this tutorial, I always had trouble learning to program, I hope to finally learn.",p
"Great explained!

Many thanks!",p
Doesn't getline() need #include <string>.......?,q
I can only leave 1x like but I would like to encourage others to do the same! This is a very good beginner-level tutorial. Thank you for making it.,p
36:00,o
I really appreciate you sharing this video. This is very informative. I haven't been able to learn this from school but now can definitely watch this and play the codes to build a program.,p
"Went through the whole video, actually typed out all the code. Learned more in one video than in my CS college C/C++ classes! A few things Mike said he would explain later, and didn't, guess he forgot, but they were small inconsequential things, easy to google. Amazing work!",p
23:30,o
this is amazing and i have only been watching 30 minutes so far. Keep up the good work.,p
27:00,o
"In the very beginning 6:10 I believe it's different for PC/Windows users. These commands don't work in the ""Terminal"" or Command Prompt. Any way around this or alternate command? Thank you :)",p
"Thanks for sharing this video. I did not even  know  that how to write a program ""Hello world"", but now I am able to do more then that. I am glad that I found this video on you tube. I have learnt so many things from it. Thanks Mike:)",p
"I know this course was some time ago now, but I am just getting started, however I have been slowly getting used to the Visual Studio Interface after much deliberation between it and other editors.  Now I am looking to actually dive into coding but not knowing anything at all, I'm already over my head and am unable to simply follow along here given most of the first half of the video is on a totally different interface.  I would think the code would be the same, but typing this ""Hello world"" code directly into visual studio came up with errors.  Im lost and am unsure how to even start to resolve basic issues. lol",q
It's been only half a year since I started learning Java(in school) and that probably helped me a lot in getting all the basics,o
22:00,o
Great video. Thanks for all your work on it. I really appreciate the time and the way you explains thing!,p
You are the best teacher I've ever seen. Please make an advance course for c++. Thanks so much sensei.,p
32:30,o
Thank you for this amazing tutorial,p
1:13:00,o
You are so good teacher thank you this video was so useful i had problem with learning c++,p
He‚Äôs a very good teacher. I already feel hopeless watching other YouTube tutorials and he is the only one who can explain it so well <3,s
1:12:15,o
Thanks you so much for the tutorial. You explain very well :),p
Why would you ever need to use pointers? Seems like you get a physical location of data but don't do anything with it?? What's so special about a pointer data type? It looks like you can't even mix data types. I get what it's doing--it's literally getting the physical location. But why??,q
"This is honestly a fantastic tutorial even for anyone learning programming for the first time. I was watching it to learn C++ specifically, but I'd say even if you had absolutely 0 programming knowledge, this is a great video to start on!",p
"Fabulous!
The best c++ tutorial I have received among dozens of videos.
God bless you!",p
i dont know why but everytime i type #include <iostream> it says that there is no such thing detected,q
"This guy did justice to C++ üôå
Specially for beginners its amazing..!!!",p
"a  friend asked for advice on some diploma on a web service. -Man , i dont remember if this dude is called Mike ,  is in youtube. seach it as code camp.",o
"Very good tutorial on C++, Thanks Mike!!",p
"great tutorial.
I hope i will pass my course",p
23:00,o
This is one of the best tutorial I've ever watch.,p
24:30,o
So far the most clear concept making video I have seen...... Thanks,p
"Thanks mate you help me learn c++,I am so grateful for all your hard work because at my school we don't have competent teachers for the computer science class.",p
what should i need to learn after completing this 4 hours video???     pls reply guys,q
"I'm going to start school and I'm panicing already. After I started to watch this video, I'm more sure, that I can learn programming, so thank you! Great video and so far I have understood everything, even english is not my native language.",p
1:05:59,o
"Excellent video! Thanks a lot :)
Just one thing: there is a typo at line 21: his name is Tolkien, pronounced tol-keen ;)",s

"Fantastic video tutorial. You have the best way of presenting material of all the guys that are out there. Showing yourself helps the viewer follow on a different level because humans normally reads into what's going on by looking at the person they are talking to. Great stuff zooming in and out like that. Perfect when watching in the phone. Also good to not jump from one view to the other. Superb sound quality. You should hear the room size and not a close radio voice. You kept your information on a constant level and explained stuff in a perfect way without getting ahead of yourself like many other tutorials tend to do: like ""that was simple so let's do something that's not"". Congratulations and many thanks for the video and for keeping it add free. Hope there's more to come.",s

"Man.. this program really sacrifices accessibility and ease of use for a broader and more of a range of things to be able to do.
Like having to use ""Bool"" to be able to set things to true or false, but then having to use int for non decimal and double for decimal.
I've used programs that just do this for you.
Like you could set Numcount1 = 5 but then change that to Numcount1 = true and it would just change the variable in the code because it recognizes that you want to change it.
The only time it would be relevant is if you wanted to have Numcount1 be all of the above at the same time but then that would make it confusing to fix if something goes wrong so I don't see the point.",s

"This tutorial is great for beginners, thanks! All the repetition throughout the course is great for watching and learning.


Learning is not a race. Most guides / tutorials will only say things once, and then expect you to be a complete master of it and maybe similar commands the next time they use them. When these crash courses get to part 2, they will be way way beyond beginner level. Although all the information needed is there and explained. Beginners won't be able to use the ""learned"" information properly that way, because they haven't formed an idea of what they saw and what it meant. They got the answer, no problem. However. Only a copy of the answer, nothing more.


If a tutorial doesn't go into great length about boring details you ""already know about"", then you know it isn't a good one. If you don't need that, then just skip the detailed parts or find a tutorial meant for those who already mastered what you're trying to learn. I bet you'll end up back where you started though, since you will need to read up again on the boring basics to understand what they are actually talking about. Though not in great length this time, no no, because those who mastered something went into serious and tedious length to research the details of the details of the basics, to be able to master what they do. It isn't the fancy stuff that will get you far. It is the details. Don't skip out on them.",s

"Awesome tutorial video for an indispensable language! Everyone should learn C++ but ALMOST no one should be using C++ imo.
Before everyone jumps down my throat, let me justify that opinion XD
 
There are 2 main reasons why one would choose to use C/C++ to develop a piece of software and those 2 reasons are also 2 reasons why people should avoid it in most instances.

1.) C/C++ has unmatched memory management given to the user that almost or no language higher gives the coder. This also means you're required to manage resources on your own for even the smallest of programs.

2.) C/C++ compiles to native binaries which runs extremely fast. However, this comes at the expense of rapid development. Ask yourself this; are you willing to sacrifice rapid development for an application speed increase that the vast majority of the time, won't even be noticeable to the end user ?( in most cases minded, data crunching large data sets will obviously yield much more favorable results for C/C++ )

A note about pointers. Don't know if it was due to trying to explain pointers as simply as possible but the explanation wasn't quite on point so here goes;

&var_name gives you a memory address to where your value is being stored.
*ptr_name gives you a memory address to where an address to where &var_name is being stored which changes if the address for var_name ever changes.

&var_name = your street address to where your house is located.
*ptr_name = a P.O Box with your street address inside to where your house is located.

with *ptr_name, your house can change; expand, or shrink, your address can change but you still keep the same P.O Box that's automatically updated with the new address.",s
"Don't forget, take notes!",s
awesome. so many thanks for this.,p
Thanks dude i got an A on my exam :),p

Also the value returned by main isn't directly going back to the os, it will return to _start that is then going to make a system call to end the program with the returned value from main.",s
